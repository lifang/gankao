                    <title>　Section A
　&lt;div&gt;　Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　Questions 48 to 57 are based on the following passage.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　When we think of green buildings, we tend to think of new ones – the kind of high-tech, solar-paneled masterpieces that make the covers of architecture magazines. But the U.S. has more than 100 million existing homes, and it would be __48__ wasteful to tear them all down and __49__ them with greener versions. An enormous amount of energy and resources went into the construction of those houses. And it would take an average of 65 years for the __50__ carbon emissions from a new energy-efficient home to make up for the resources lost by destroying an old one. So in the broadest __51__, the greenest home is the one that has already been built. But at the same time, nearly half of U. S. carbon emissions come from heating, cooling and __52__ our homes, offices and other buildings. &quot;You can&apos;t deal with climate change without dealing with existing buildings,&quot; says Richard Moe, the president of the National Trust.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　With some __53__, the oldest homes tend to be the least energy-efficient. Houses built before 1939 use about 50% more energy per square foot than those built after 2000, mainly due to the tiny cracks and gaps that __54__ over time and let in more outside air.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　Fortunately, there are a __55__ number of relatively simple changes that can green older homes, from __56__ ones like Lincoln&apos;s Cottage to your own postwar home. And efficiency upgrades (升级) can save more than just the earth; they can help __57__ property owners from rising power costs.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A) accommodations
　B) clumsy
　　C) doubtful
　　 &amp;nbsp;D) exceptions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;E) expand
　　 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; F) historic
　　G) incredibly
　 &amp;nbsp; H) powering
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I) protect
　　 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; J) reduced
　　K) replace
　　 &amp;nbsp;L) sense
　　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;M) shifted
　　 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; N) supplying
　O) vast&lt;/div&gt;
