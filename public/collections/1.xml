                    <title>&lt;div&gt;　 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Caught in the Web
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　A few months ago， it wasn&apos;t unusual for 47-year-old Carla Toebe to spend 15 hours per day online. She&apos;d wake up early， turn on her laptop and chat on Internet dating sites and instant-messaging programs – leaving her bed for only brief intervals. Her household bills piled up， along with the dishes and dirty laundry， but it took near-constant complaints from her four daughters before she realized she had a problem.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　&quot;I was starting to feel like my whole world was falling apart – kind of slipping into a depression，&quot; said Carla. &quot;I knew that if I didn&apos;t get off the dating sites， I&apos;d just keep going，&quot; detaching （使脱离） herself further from the outside world.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　Toebe&apos;s conclusion： She felt like she was &quot;addicted&quot; to the Internet. She&apos;s not alone.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　Concern about excessive Internet use isn&apos;t new. As far back as 1995， articles in medical journals and the establishment of a Pennsylvania treatment center for overusers generated interest in the subject. There&apos;s still no consensus on how much time online constitutes too much or whether addiction is possible.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　But as reliance on the Web grows， there are signs that the question is getting more serious attention： Last month， a study published in CNS Spectrums claimed to be the first large-scale look at excessive Internet use. The American Psychiatric Association may consider listing Internet addiction in the next edition of its diagnostic manual. And scores of online discussion boards have popped up on which people discuss negative experiences tied to too much time on the Web.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　&quot;There&apos;s no question that there&apos;re people who&apos;re seriously in trouble because they&apos;re overdoing their Internet involvement，&quot; said psychiatrist （精神科医生） Ivan Goldberg. Goldberg calls the problem a disorder rather than a true addiction.
　　Jonathan Bishop， a researcher in Wales specializing in online communities， is more skeptical. &quot;The Internet is an environment，&quot; he said. &quot;You can&apos;t be addicted to the environment.&quot; Bishop describes the problem as simply a matter of priorities， which can be solved by encouraging people to prioritize other life goals and plans in place of time spent online.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　The new CNS Spectrums study was based on results of a nationwide telephone survey of more than 2，500 adults. Like the 2005 survey， this one was conducted by Stanford University researchers.About 6% of respondents reported that &quot;their relationships suffered because of excessive Internet use.&quot; About 9% attempted to conceal &quot;nonessential Internet use，&quot; and nearly 4% reported feeling &quot;preoccupied by the Internet when offline.&quot;
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　About 8% said they used the Internet as a way to escape problems， and almost 14% reported they &quot;found it hard to stay away from the Internet for several days at a time.&quot;
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　&quot;The Internet problem is still in its infancy，&quot; said Elias Aboujaoude， a Stanford professor. No single online activity is to blame for excessive use， he said. &quot;They&apos;re online in chat rooms， checking e-mail， or writing blogs. [The problem is] not limited to porn （色情） or gambling&quot; websites.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　Excessive Internet use should be defined not by the number of hours spent online but &quot;in terms of losses，&quot; said Maressa Orzack， a Harvard University professor. &quot;If it&apos;s a loss [where] you&apos;re not getting to work， and family relationships are breaking down as a result， then it&apos;s too much.&quot;
　　Since the early 1990s， several clinics have been established in the U. S. to treat heavy Internet users. They include the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery and the Center for Internet Behavior.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　The website for Orzack&apos;s center lists the following among the psychological symptoms of computer addiction：
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　● Having a sense of well-being （幸福） or excitement while at the computer.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　● Longing for more and more time at the computer.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　● Neglect of family and friends.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　● Feeling empty， depressed or irritable when not at the computer.
　　● Lying to employers and family about activities.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　● Inability to stop the activity.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　● Problems with school or job.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　Physical symptoms listed include dry eyes， backaches， skipping meals， poor personal hygiene （卫生） and sleep disturbances.
　　People who struggle with excessive Internet use maybe depressed or have other mood disorders， Orzack said. When she discusses Internet habits with her patients， they often report that being online offers a &quot;sense of belonging， and escape， excitement [and] fun，&quot; she said. &quot;Some people say relief…because they find themselves so relaxed.&quot;
　　Some parts of the Internet seem to draw people in more than others. Internet gamers spend countless hours competing in games against people from all over the world. One such game， called World of Warcraft， is cited on many sites by posters complaining of a &quot;gaming addiction.&quot;
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　Andrew Heidrich， an education network administrator from Sacramento， plays World of Warcraft for about two to four hours every other night， but that&apos;s nothing compared with the 40 to 60 hours a week he spent playing online games when he was in college. He cut back only after a full-scale family intervention （干预）， in which relatives told him he&apos;d gained weight.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　&quot;There&apos;s this whole culture of competition that sucks people in&quot; with online gaming， said Heidrich， now a father of two. &quot;People do it at the expense of everything that was a constant in their lives.&quot; Heidrich now visits websites that discuss gaming addiction regularly &quot;to remind myself to keep my love for online games in check.&quot;
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　Toebe also regularly visits a site where posters discuss Internet overuse. In August， when she first realized she had a problem， she posted a message on a Yahoo Internet addiction group with the subject line： &quot;I have an Internet Addiction.&quot;
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　&quot;I&apos;m self-employed and need the Internet for my work， but I&apos;m failing to accomplish my work，to take care of my home， to give attention to my children，&quot; she wrote in a message sent to the group.&quot;I have no money or insurance to get professional help； I can&apos;t even pay my mortgage （抵押贷款） and face losing everything.&quot;
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　Since then， Toebe said， she has kept her promise to herself to cut back on her Internet use. &quot;I have a boyfriend now， and I&apos;m not interested in online dating，&quot; she said by phone last week. &quot;It&apos;s a lot better now.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

                            <analysis>&lt;p&gt;24. A) The pocket money British children get.
原题为 What is the table of figures about? 意思是：这个表格是关于什么的？根据第一句话Now you’ve seen this table of figures about the pocket money children in Britain get? 我们可以知道这个表格是关于英国孩子的零花钱情况的。&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;W： Now you’ve seen this table of figures about the pocket money children in Britain get? 　　M： Yes． I thought it was quite interesting， but I don’t quite understand the column entitled change． Can you explain what it means? 　　W： Well， I think it means the change from the year before． I am not a mathematician， but I assume the rise from 70p to 90p is a rise of 25 percent． 　　M： Oh yes， I see． And the inflation rate is there for comparison． 　　W： Yes． why do you think the rise in pocket money is often higher than inflation? 　　M： I am sorry I’ve no idea． Perhaps parents in Britain are too generous． 　　W： Perhaps they are． But it looks as if children were not better off in 2001 than they were in 2002． That’s strange， isn’t it? And they seem to have been better off in 2003 than they are now． I wonder why that is． 　　M： Yes， I don’t understand that at all． 　　W： Anyway， if you had children， how much pocket money would you give them? 　　M： I don’t know． I think I’ll probably give them 2 pounds a week． 　　W： Would you? And what would you expect them to do with it? 　　M： Well， out of that， they have to buy some small personal things， but I wouldn’t expect them to save to buy their own socks， for example． 　　W： Yes， by the way， do most children in your country get pocket money? 　　M： Yeah， they do．&lt;/p&gt;

原题为What do we learn from the conversation about British children’s pocket money? 意思是：从对话中我们可以了解到有关英国孩子零花钱的哪些信息？原文中女性说话人说“Why do you think the rise in pocket money is often higher than inflation? ”意思是：“你觉得为什么零花钱通常要比通货膨胀涨的更高呢？”据此我们可以判断英国孩子的零花钱比通货膨胀涨的更高，答案应选C.&lt;/p&gt;

原题为Supposing the man had children, what would he expect them to do with their pocket money? 对话中男性说话人说“…out of that, they have to buy some small personal things, but I wouldn’t expect them to save to buy their own socks, for example.”意思是“我希望他们用零花钱去买一些小的个人物品，但我不希望他们把钱存起来去买他们自己的短袜等”。据此我们可以判断答案选B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the new sales director for a national computer firm， Alex Gordon was looking forward to his first meeting with the company’s district managers． Everyone arrived on time， and Alex’s presentation went extremely well． He decided to end the meeting with the conversation about the importance of the district managers to the company’s plans． “I believe we are going to continue to increase our share of the market，” he began， “because of the quality of the people in this room． The district manager is the key to the success of the sales representatives in his district． He sets the term for everyone else． If he has ambitious goals and is willing to put in long hours， everyone in his unit will follow his example．” When Alex was finished， he received polite applauses， but hardly the warm response he had hoped for． Later he spoke with one of the senior managers． “Things were going so well until the end”， Alex said disappointedly． “Obviously， I said the wrong thing．” “Yes”， the district manager replied． “Half of our managers are women． Most have worked their way up from sales representatives， and they are very proud of the role they played in the company’s growth． They don’t care at all about political correctness． But they were definitely surprised and distressed to be referred to as ‘he’ in your speech．”&lt;/p&gt;

                            <analysis>&lt;p&gt;28 D) The important part played by district managers
文章中提到在会议结束时，Alex打算以“the conversation about the importance of the district managers to the company plans”来结束会议，可见他打算强调district managers在公司计划中所起的重要作用。因此D项正确。
&lt;/p&gt;

                            <analysis>&lt;p&gt;29 B) Fifty percent of them were female
此题比较简单，文章中后面说道“Half of our managers are women”， 而参加会议的基本上都是那些district managers，由此可判断，会议的听众有一半是女性，所以此题选B项。&lt;/p&gt;

文章最后一句说这些女性district managers听到Alex总用“he”来指代“district managers”感到surprised和distressed（痛苦的，苦恼的），由此可见Alex失败的原因是由于他对于涉及到性别的用词不够敏感所造成的。&lt;/p&gt;

此题比较简单，原文中提到在餐馆遇到上错菜时，应该“make a polite but firm request to see the manage”,和C项所说完全一致。&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The way to complain is to act business－like and important． If your complaint is immediate， suppose you got the wrong order at a restaurant， make a polite but firm request to see the manager． When the manager comes， ask his or her name． And then state your problem and what you expect to have done about it． Be polite！ Shouting or acting rude will get you nowhere． But also be firm in making your complaint． Besides， act important． This doesn’t mean to put on airs and say “do you know who I am?” What it means is that people are often treated the way they expect to be treated． If you act like someone who expects a fair request to be granted， chances are it will be granted． The worst way to complain is over the telephone． You are speaking to a voice coming from someone you cannot see． So you can’t tell how the person on the line is reacting． It is easy for that person to give you the run－around． Complaining in person or by letter is generally more effective． If your complaint doesn’t require an immediate response， it often helps to complain by letter． If you have an appliance that doesn’t work， send a letter to the store that sold it． Be business－like and stick to the point． Don’t spend a paragraph on how your uncle John tried to fix the problem and couldn’t．&lt;/p&gt;

                    <title>　Section A
　&lt;div&gt;　Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　Questions 48 to 57 are based on the following passage.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　When we think of green buildings, we tend to think of new ones – the kind of high-tech, solar-paneled masterpieces that make the covers of architecture magazines. But the U.S. has more than 100 million existing homes, and it would be __48__ wasteful to tear them all down and __49__ them with greener versions. An enormous amount of energy and resources went into the construction of those houses. And it would take an average of 65 years for the __50__ carbon emissions from a new energy-efficient home to make up for the resources lost by destroying an old one. So in the broadest __51__, the greenest home is the one that has already been built. But at the same time, nearly half of U. S. carbon emissions come from heating, cooling and __52__ our homes, offices and other buildings. &quot;You can&apos;t deal with climate change without dealing with existing buildings,&quot; says Richard Moe, the president of the National Trust.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　With some __53__, the oldest homes tend to be the least energy-efficient. Houses built before 1939 use about 50% more energy per square foot than those built after 2000, mainly due to the tiny cracks and gaps that __54__ over time and let in more outside air.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　Fortunately, there are a __55__ number of relatively simple changes that can green older homes, from __56__ ones like Lincoln&apos;s Cottage to your own postwar home. And efficiency upgrades (升级) can save more than just the earth; they can help __57__ property owners from rising power costs.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A) accommodations
　B) clumsy
　　C) doubtful
　　 &amp;nbsp;D) exceptions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;E) expand
　　 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; F) historic
　　G) incredibly
　 &amp;nbsp; H) powering
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I) protect
　　 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; J) reduced
　　K) replace
　　 &amp;nbsp;L) sense
　　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;M) shifted
　　 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; N) supplying
　O) vast&lt;/div&gt;

                    <title>Section B
　&lt;div&gt;　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　Passage One
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　Questions 58 to 62 are based on the following passage.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　You never see him, but they&apos;re with you every time you fly. They record where you are going,how fast you&apos;re traveling and whether everything on your airplane is functioning normally. Their ability to withstand almost any disaster makes them seem like something out of a comic book.They&apos;re known as the black box.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　When planes fall from the sky, as a Yemeni airliner did on its way to Comoros Islands in the India ocean June 30, 2009, the black box is the best bet for identifying what went wrong. So when a French submarine (潜水艇) detected the device&apos;s homing signal five days later, the discovery marked a huge step toward determining the cause of a tragedy in which 152 passengers were killed.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　In 1958, Australian scientist David Warren developed a flight-memory recorder that would track basic information like altitude and direction. That was the first mode for a black box, which became a requirement on all U.S. commercial flights by 1960. Early models often failed to withstand crashes, however, so in 1965 the device was completely redesigned and moved to the rear of the plane – the area least subject to impact – from its original position in the landing wells (起落架舱). The same year, the Federal Aviation Authority required that the boxes, which were never actually black, be painted orange or yellow to aid visibility.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;　Modern airplanes have two black boxes: a voice recorder, which tracks pilots&apos; conversations,and a flight-data recorder, which monitors fuel levels, engine noises and other operating functions that help investigators reconstruct the aircraft&apos;s final moments. Placed in an insulated (隔绝的) case and surrounded by a quarter-inch-thick panels of stainless steel, the boxes can withstand massive force and temperatures up to 2,000℉. When submerged, they&apos;re also able to emit signals from depths of 20,000 ft. Experts believe the boxes from Air France Flight 447, which crashed near Brazil on June 1,2009, are in water nearly that deep, but statistics say they&apos;re still likely to turn up. In the approximately 20 deep-sea crashes over the past 30 years, only one plane&apos;s black boxes were never recovered.&lt;/div&gt;

ward off指“避开，防止”。黑匣子并不能避免灾难发生，因此C选项不正确。indispensable，不能缺少的，文中多次举例黑匣子在事故发生后起到至关重要的作用，因此此选项正确。

本文第二段介绍了黑匣子在对于探寻Yemeni airliner坠毁原因上所起到的重大作用。由第二段第二行”the black box is the best bet for identifying what went wrong”以及后面由于法国一潜艇找到黑匣子这一发现”marked a huge step toward determining the cause of a tragedy”可以推断出答案。

                            <analysis>60. C) The early models often got damaged in the crash.
文中第三自然段第三行，由”Early models often failed to withstand crashes, however, so in 1965 the device was completely redesigned…”可得知，1965年黑匣子重新设计的原因是之前的黑匣子在坠机时容易遭到破坏。withstand意为“承受，经受”。

由文中得知黑匣子被漆成橙色或黄色的原因是” to aid visibility”。Visibility是visible的名词形式，意为“能见度，可见度”，因此，漆成橙色或黄色主要是因为希望黑匣子可见度高，比较明显，容易被发现，故选C。

作者举出Air France Flight 447的例子主要是用来证明其前面的论点”When submerged, they’re also able to emit signals form depths of 20,000 ft.”意为黑匣子即使被埋于深处仍然能够发射信号以被察觉。Air France Flight 447的黑匣子处于水下深处，但数据显示他们仍能”turn up”（出现），即被探测人员发现。故选A。

                    <title>Passage Two
　&lt;div&gt;　Questions 63 to 67 are based on the following passage.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　The $11 billion self-help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like &quot;I never do anything right&quot; into positive ones like &quot;I can succeed.&quot; But was positive thinking advocate Norman Vincent Peale right? Is there power in positive thinking?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　　Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　The study&apos;s authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your dim friend that he has the potential of an Einstein, you&apos;re just underlining his faults. In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students&apos; self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, &quot;I am lovable.&quot;
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　Those with low self-esteem didn&apos;t feel better after the forced self-affirmation. In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren&apos;t urged to think positive thoughts.
　&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;　The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy (心理治疗) that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation (静思) techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic perspective. Call it the power of negative thinking.&lt;/div&gt;

细节理解题
本题是问从文章第一段中我们能够了解自我帮助产业的哪些情况。文章第一句就说自我帮助产业是建立在把消极思考转化为积极思考的基础之上，因此B项是正确 的。虽然文章一开始虽然说自我帮助产业的规模有110亿美元，但这只是说产业规模，并没有提到该行业具有很高的利润率，因此不能由此判断A项就是正确的。 文章中只说Norman Vincent是积极思考的倡导者，并没有说该行业是由他创立的，因此C项不正确。第一段末尾作者就质疑积极思考是否真的有效，因此D项不是正确选项。

细节归纳题
本题问加拿大研究学者的发现是什么，文章第二段提到他们发表的文章里说让人们更积极地思考实际上会产生相反的效果，只会起到强调人们又多不开心的作用。后 面又用实验来说明了这个观点，在文章的第三段和第五段也都再次说到积极思考会起到相反作用，使人们更不开心。因此本题选A项。

细节理解题
本题问从文章最后一段我们可以了解些什么，毫无疑问答案自然是在文章最后一段。在这一段里，作者说文章还推荐人们把静思作为一种心理治疗的方法，因此应当 选B项。文章只是说静思可以帮助人们学会接受自己的不足，把自己的不足放到更广泛的层面去思考，但并没有说静思可以使人们避免犯错误。因此D项不正确。
